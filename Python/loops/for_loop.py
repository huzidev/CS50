#IN python we reads for loop more like english sentence like
# for (i) in (3 times ) therefore we specified and indexified

# for i in [0, 1, 2]:
#     print("Hello")

#but what if we wanted to iterate 100x do we right to 100 in square brackets no

for i in range(3): # RANGE means start from zero
    print("Hello")
